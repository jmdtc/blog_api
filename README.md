# blog_api

## Installation

Devmode using nodemon:
```
git clone https://github.com/jmdtc/blog_api.git
cd blog_api
npm install
npm start
```
There is also a small run build to test transpiling in js:
```
npm run build
node ./dist/server.js
```

## Thoughts on the task
The task in itself was something I had already done, so no problem on that. However, it was my first time using Typescript in a 'complete' project and also my first time using Sequelize, therefore I took some time to learn about them and, even though I wanted to add some tests, decided to send the project like this as I received the instructions one week ago.

Besides that, I went for a simple and straightforward solution as the project was small, but easily understandable I hope. A real-life example would probably need some refactoring though, such as using express Router and using classes for controllers.
